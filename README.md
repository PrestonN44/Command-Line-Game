# Game
A little game I made to run on command line.
To play: make sure you have installed "make", then build using the make command (may be "mingw32-make" or simply "make" depending on how you installed make).
         An executable called "run" should have been created. If in command prompt, simply type "run". If in powershell, type "./run".
